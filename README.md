## Appendix

Every year lakhs of junior college students pass their H.S.C and enter engineering colleges. While going through the admission procedure students need to enter some minimum count of colleges where they might have a chance to get admission. Because of this, a candidate needs to prepare a list of colleges to which he/she intends to get admission. This task of list generation requires a large amount of manual searching, comparing different prospects of colleges.

The goal of this project was to automate this college list generation. Aim was to reduce all this manual work by making a system that can effectively and efficiently generate a list of colleges in which a candidate is eligible based on the official database provided by the government. Recommendation systems solve the problem of "Information Overload" of searching through large volumes of data.
